        the information is about, Other hold the mean capability for that hour considering GA and MIL for both arrival and departure, Airport is the name of the airport and remaining columns are about the weather information.  Data are extracted from various sources which are:                                              For capacity of the airport link is https://aspm.faa.gov/tfms/sys/OPSNET.asp                          For weather data link is https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-hourly?pageNum=1

This file is used as the training data for the neural network.
